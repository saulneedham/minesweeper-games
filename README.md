# Minesweeper-Games
A collection of three Minesweeper implementations developed in Haskell, C, and Python to demonstrate three distinct programming paradigms. Each version includes custom gameplay mechanics, such as a "place bomb" feature to reveal or remove squares and a "remove row" ability to clear entire rows from the board.

## 📘 Included Projects

* minesweeper.hs - A functional programming implementation emphasizing immutability, recursion, and pure functions to manage game state and board transformations.
* minesweeper.c - A procedural programming version focused on manual memory management, pointer manipulation, and structured top-down execution.
* minesweeper.py - An object-oriented programming (OOP) approach utilizing classes and methods to encapsulate game logic, board properties, and player actions.

## 🛠 Built With

Haskell (Functional)
C (Procedural)
